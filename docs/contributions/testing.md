## Run the tests

#### 1. Install the global dependencies

```shell
npm ci
```

#### 2. Run Backend unit tests

- Install data provider

```shell
npm run build:data-provider
```

- Run backend unit tests

```shell
cd api && npm run test:ci
```

- Run librechat-data-provider unit tests

```shell
cd packages/data-provider && npm run test:ci
```

#### 3. Run frontend unit tests

- Build Client

```shell
npm npm run frontend:ci
```

- Run frontend unit tests

```shell
npm run test:ci --verbose
```

#### 4. Run e2e tests

- Install Playwright

```shell
npx playwright install --with-deps
npx playwright install chromium
```

- Run Playwright tests

```shell
